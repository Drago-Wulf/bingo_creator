# Bingo Creator

## Intro
Aydanfox was looking for a quick way to generate an array.  This is a quick Python program that takes a list in a text file and creates a board within the console.

## Usage

`--file File Name` - name of the file that is used to store the list of challenges.  This should be a single column csv file.

`--rows` - number of rows for the bingo board

`--columns` - number of columns for the bingo board

```
python .\bingo_generator.py --file skyrim.txt --rows 5 --columns 5
```
